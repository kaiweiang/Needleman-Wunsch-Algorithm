# Needleman-Wunsch-Algorithm
A global alignment algorithm used in bioinformatics to align protein or nucleotide sequences.

##Prerequisites
Matlab

## Additioal Information:
An anchored version of the standard Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is also included. It is basically a wrapper that assumes known matched regions 
between two sequences and applies Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to align the unaligned regions between the matched ones.  

PAX and HOX proteins from human and fruit fly, TITIN proteins from human and mouse, and their respective 
known matched regions are provided as an application to the algorithm.
